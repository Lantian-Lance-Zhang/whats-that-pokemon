                    With now more than 800 different kinds of Pokémons, it is becoming hard for even the most loyal fans of the Pokémon franchise to recognize and name every one of those species. This website is made in an attempt to solve this issue!
                    Using Google's free and open-source python library Tensorflow, we trained an AI to recognize generation 1 Pokémons. Obviously, the 151 generation-1 Pokémons is only a small portion of the total 807, but this is
                    definitely a good starting point and, hopefully, one day we can make an AI classify all the Pokémons in existence.

            <h3>
                Nintendo Co., Ltd. is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and video game company headquartered in Kyoto. Nintendo is one of the world's largest video game companies by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and top-selling video game franchises of all-time, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pokémon.
                Founded on 23 September 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi, it originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards. By 1963, the company had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and love hotels. Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo developed into a video game company in the 1970s.
                Supplemented since the 1980s by its major divisions Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe, it ultimately became one of the most influential in the industry and one of Japan's most-valuable companies with a market value of over $37 billion in 2018.
